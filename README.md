Vender is an Android launcher based on search. With Vender, everything is in search. What's more, the themes could be changed, the searching function would be dynamically updated. For the situations where only simple function is required such as calculating one plus one, looking up some words in dictionary, or checking currency rate, you do not need to leave this launcher to get things done. We hope Vender will grow to be a community where eveyone can work on its themes and functionalities.
